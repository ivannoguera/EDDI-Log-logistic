# SPEI

An R package incorporating a set of functions for computing potential or reference evapotranspiration and several widely used drought indices, currently including the **Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)** and the **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPE)**.

The package is centered on the SPEI. For more information on this drought index, please visit 
[spei.csic.es](http://spei.csic.es/).


## Details

Functions `<spei>` and `<spi>` are the workhorse of the SPEI library. Other functions such as `<kern>`, `<cdfglo>` or `<pglo>` are auxiliary low-level functions and they will not be used directly by the typical user. Functions for computing potential evapotranspiration are provided, too, for helping computing the SPEI. These are: `<thornthwaite>`, `<hargreaves>` and `<penman>`.
